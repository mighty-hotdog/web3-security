# Diary of a Security Researcher

## My journey begins

4th April 2024. I started my journey in earnest. I began by digging into Patrick Collins' Cyfrin Updraft course.

## ...

## Completed Cyfrin Updraft

10th July 2024. Finally, I am about to complete Cyfrin Updraft. Not quite actually...just the foundational Solidity and Foundry material, the Security and Audit course, and the Wallets and Post-Deployment short course.

What is outstanding is the important but math-heavy Formal Verification course, which I will leave for later.

After I complete everything today, I move on to:
- some invariant testing practice
  - code up the invariant tests for past projects
  - explore invariant test suites done by others
- explore the Solodit checklist (https://solodit.xyz/checklist)
- explore SC-Exploits-Minimized https://github.com/Cyfrin/sc-exploits-minimized

## Took a Hiatus...too long...

Dropped off the journey somewhere in July 2024. Wasted the next 6 months until December 2024 with nothing to show for.
Restarting again 7th January 2025.

Will do catchup for 2 days: coding and testing Solidity, Github and other tools, revisit Solodit and other audit resources
Collect own resources for learning:
- audit reports
- notable experts who share their knowledge in blogs or X posts

Pick up where I left off:
- coding DApps
  - Solidity, Rust, Vyper, frontend, datastore
  - build a couple personal projects
  - find and join development on a couple Open Source projects
- invariant testing
- formal verification
- smart contracts devops, management (before + after publish)

## Dealing with false starts...keep trying...

New set of plans in Notion.

Got back into the code for 1st time since July 2024. Going through old cyfrin projects 1st, then running through Solidty By Example, and the Solidity docs. Head down and work through stuff until I get back to all cylinders firing.

Restarted exercise with daily fast walks. Improved time spent with wife. Perseverance is the Key.

Trump just got inaugurated as 47th. Things getting better already. 2025 looks bright and hopeful.
