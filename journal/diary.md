# Diary of a Security Researcher

## My journey begins

4th April 2024. I started my journey in earnest. I began by digging into Patrick Collins' Cyfrin Updraft course.

## Completed Cyfrin Updraft

10th July 2024. Finally, I am about to complete Cyfrin Updraft. Not quite actually...just the foundational Solidity and Foundry material, the Security and Audit course, and the Wallets and Post-Deployment short course.

What is outstanding is the important but math-heavy Formal Verification course, which I will leave for later.

After I complete everything today, I move on to:
- some invariant testing practice
  - code up the invariant tests for past projects
  - explore invariant test suites done by others
- explore the Solodit checklist (https://solodit.xyz/checklist)
- explore SC-Exploits-Minimized https://github.com/Cyfrin/sc-exploits-minimized
